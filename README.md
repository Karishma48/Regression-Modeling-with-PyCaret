Exploring Regression Modeling with PyCaret


I'm excited to share my recent work with PyCaret, a low-code machine learning library that simplifies model selection, training, and evaluation. PyCaret enables quick comparison of 20+ regression models, making it an efficient tool for data scientists and analysts.


Project Overview

ðŸ”¹ Developed a Regression Model using PyCaret in Google Colab

ðŸ”¹ Explored PyCaretâ€™s 50+ built-in datasets and selected the Bike dataset

ðŸ”¹ Worked with 1,000 samples, splitting the data into 90% training & 10% testing

ðŸ”¹ Conducted two experiments:

Without preprocessing

With preprocessing for enhanced performance

ðŸ”¹ Compared multiple models and selected the top 3 performers

ðŸ”¹ Trained and tuned an XGBoost model, achieving 89.65% accuracy

ðŸ”¹ Visualized key insights using charts like Prediction Error, Learning Curve, and Validation Curve

ðŸ”¹ Applied ensemble techniques such as blending and stacking for improved predictions

ðŸ”¹ Finalized and saved the model for future use

PyCaretâ€™s automated workflow significantly streamlined the entire process, from data preprocessing to model selection and evaluation. Looking forward to leveraging this approach for real-world applications.


I would love to hear your thoughts and feedback! Letâ€™s connect and discuss more.
